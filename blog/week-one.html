    <h1>Squad Goals: A Jumping Off Point for Career Transitions</h1>

        <p>Starting a new professional journey is not for the faint of heart. While I've done it several times now over the past decade of "adulting," there always seems to be anxiety and stress that go in to both the "lasts" and the "firsts" that all happen in rapid succession. 
            </p>
        <p>For those who are unaware, I recently resigned from my position as a Web Content Manager so that I can focus on learning web development and delving even deeper into User Experience design. 
            I'm now an apprentice (read: student) at <a href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com" target="_blank" alt ="link to Nashville Software School's website"></a>Nashville Software School</a>. 
            It's very scary to exchange a stable job for six months as a student, but I am confident that this is the next right step for me. 
            And yet, having that confidence in my decision doesn't keep me from moments of doubt. 
            After just my first week of class with almost 30 other people making these same new beginnings, there have been several moments of both certainty and fear. </p>
        <p>In part, it can be a bit lonely to begin again. Walking in to a lunch room where you don't anyone isn't any less awkward than it was for me as a sixteen-year-old in a new town. 
            While I do feel these situations are a bit easier now, there is still a sense of wanting to fit in and find someone to connect with. 
            And so, even beyond the coding, I can say that this is my biggest takeaway from my first week at NSS: </p>
        <aside class="pull-quote">Build your support team. Gather your squad. And let them be there for you. 
        </aside>
        <p>Build your support team. Gather your squad. And let them support you. I'm lucky in that I have a few friends who have made very similar transition in the past few years and know something of what I'm going through. 
        </p>
        <p>In particular, it was a huge encouragement when I got the text at the top of this post from <a href="http://adamwheatley.com/" target="_blank">my friend Adam. Earlier in the week <a href="http://karafulgum.com/">Kara (Fulgum) Luton</a> reached out to me when she saw a post I made about starting school â€” she went through a coding bootcamp a few years back and knows how this goes. (As a fun side note, Kara and Adam work together now.) Just having some people willing to check on me and take the time to cheer me on has been so key in keeping my spirits up this week.</p>
        <p>My partner, Stephen, and I also built in some time to celebrate. He graciously put our anniversary dinner date off for a few days so that I could get through my first week of school. For me, it doubled the celebration to look back on our second year together while also looking forward to what this year will bring. A nice meal together was the perfect occasion to look forward to during the week and a not-too-shabby way to bring this week to a close.</p>
        <p>Now of course, it's not all warm and fuzzy. There is still plenty of pre-work to finish up (though, thankfully I found that this is quite common), and I have moments of remembering that this may be a crazy plan, but here I am. Trying to remember how important it is to build your own community when you don't have colleagues to fall back on.</p>
        <p>If you're still reading this far, be sure to leave me a comment of encouragement or advice on how you got through your own transitions!  </p>
