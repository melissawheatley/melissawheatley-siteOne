    <h1>Setting Boundaries</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>NSS Week Three</h2>
        <p>Blog idea: Writing about diving into the coding through refactoring and staying up until 5am to work on my first group project. include screenshots of the website and the project presentation file.   </p>
        <p>This is also the blog where I wanted to talk about OrangeTheory and being able to both set my own pace but live within certain boundaries as it related to class.</p>
        <p>I can also mention the Ross Jones SEO meetup.</p>
